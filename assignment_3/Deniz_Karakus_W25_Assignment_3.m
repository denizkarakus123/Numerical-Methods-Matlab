%% Question 1:  *(8 marks)*
% You are given an orthonormal basis $\bf{Q} \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times q}$ which 
% defines a subspace $\mathcal P$. You are also given a vector $\bf{b} \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$  
% which is not in that subspace   (i.e. $\bf{b} \notin \mathcal P$). 
% 
% a. Is it possible to express $\textbf{b}$ as  $\textbf{b} = \alpha_1  \textbf{ 
% q}_1 + \alpha_2  \textbf{ q}_2+ \dots + \alpha_q   \textbf{ q}_q$ where$\textbf{ 
% q}_1, \textbf{ q}_2, \dots, \textbf{q}_q$ are the columns of  $\textbf{Q}$ and 
% $\( \alpha_1, \alpha_2, \dots  \alpha_q\)$ are the scalars? Justify your answer.
% 
% 
% 
% *No! By the definition of a subspace, if b is not in the same subspace* $\mathcal 
% P$ *as Q, we can't write b as a linear combination of the columns of the vector 
% Q. Therefore, it is not possible to express b as a1q1+a2q2+...*
% 
% 
% 
% 
%% 
% 
% 
% b. Write the most efficient algorithm (a pseudocode) that you can develop 
% for computing the vector $\bf{p} \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$, $\bf{p} \in \mathcal P$ 
% which is the orthogonal projection of $\textbf{b}$ onto the subspace $\mathcal 
% P$.
% 
% *function orthogonal_projection(Q, b):*
% 
% *#could implement this using a loop, but direct matrix operations should be 
% the most efficient* 
% 
% *#calculate Q^T* b*
% 
% *temp = transpose(Q) * b*
% 
% *#now calculate p = QQ^Tb*
% 
% *return Q * temp* 
% 
% 
%% Question 2: *(10 marks)*
% You are given a vector $\mathbf{v}$ $\in \mathbb{R}^n$. Your task is to develop 
% and implement an algorithm that computes an orthonormal matrix $\mathbf{Q} \in 
% \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ such that $\mathbf{Q} \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{e}_1$, where 
% $\mathbf{e}_1$ is the first column of the identity matrix. Write a MATLAB program 
% that implements this algorithm. Explain why this algorithm works. How does it 
% relate to the Householder QR algorithm?
% 
% 
    %get the unit vector v
    unit_v = v/norm(v);
    e1 = zeros(size(v));
    e1(1) = 1;
    %if unit vector is already in line with e1, just return identity matrix
    if norm(unit_v - e1) < 1e-15
        Q = eye(length(v));
        return;
    end
    %now use our equation that we've seen in class with the Householder 
    %householder vector
    u = e1 - unit_v;
    %householder transformation using the equation from the slides 
    Q = eye(length(v)) - 2 * (u*u')/(u'*u);
end
%% 
% *Basically, we want a single householder reflection Q that sends the standard 
% basis vector e1 to the normalized vector v/||v||. A Householder reflection flips 
% vectors across the hyperplane that's orthogonal to u. By choosing u = e1 - unit_v, 
% we force Qe1 to land exactly on the unit vector of v. In other words, we're 
% "sending" e1 to v/||v|| using Q. This algorithm relates to the Householder QR 
% algorithm because instead of applying a sequence of reflections to zero out 
% below-diagonal entries of a matrix A, here we're only using one Householder 
% reflection that sends e1 to v/||v||. We use the same equation as in the Householder 
% method, but just once.*  
% 
% 
%% Question 3:  QR Decomposition *(12 marks)*
% In this question we will develop the different algorithms to implment QR factorization.
% 
% a)  Use the cell below to implement a function that computes Gram-Schmidt 
% based QR decompositon of a input matrix A.
% 
% Use the cell blow to test the your method by comparing the computing the ${\left\|A-Q\;R\right\|}_F$. 
% Use the Frobenius  norm in the MATLAB, comment on your result.
   A = rand(15,6); % A is a 15x6 matrix of random numbers
   [Qgs,Rgs] = gschmidt(A);
   
   %use the norm to check 
   normGS = norm(A-Qgs*Rgs,'fro') ;
%% 
% *When I run the cell above, I get a norm of order 1e-16 which is effectively 
% at machine precision. Or in other words, a very small norm, which means that 
% the classical Gram-Schmidt based QR decompositon produced a very accurate factorization 
% for this matrix.* 
%% 
% b)  Use the cell below to implement a function that uses the Modiefied Gram-Schmidt 
% approach to compute the  QR decompositon of  the input matrix A.
% 
% Use the cell blow to test the your method by comparing the computing the ${\left\|A-Q\;R\right\|}_F$. 
% Use the Frobenius  norm in the MATLAB, comment on your result.
% 
% *For the cell below, we get a norm also of order 1e-16. Again, This small 
% norm means the modified Gram-Schmidt approach produces a very accurate QR decomposition 
% for this matrix.* 
   A = rand(15,6); % A is a 15x6 matrix of random numbers
   [Qmgs,Rmgs] = mgschmidt(A);
   
   normMGS = norm(A-Qmgs*Rmgs,'fro');  
%% 
% c) We know that $\mathit{\mathbf{Q}}$ matrix obtained using QR decompostion 
% should have orthonormal columns i.e. ${\mathit{\mathbf{Q}}}^{\mathit{\mathbf{T}}} 
% \mathit{\mathbf{Q}}=\mathit{\mathbf{I}}$. However, due to numerical errors, 
% In this section we will test the functions written above to compare the error 
% between the above implemeneted approaches. In oder to do this we will use a 
% $n\times n$ HIlbert Matrix. The Hilbert matrices become increasingly ill-conditioned 
% as their size grows.. The entries of Hibert Matrix are given by 
% 
% $$h_{i,j} =\frac{1}{\;i+j-1}$$
% 
% In the cell below we compute the QR decomposition of Hilbert matrices of size 
% ranging from 2 to 16, then we compute the norm of error $\left({\mathit{\mathbf{Q}}}^{\mathit{\mathbf{T}}} 
% \mathit{\mathbf{Q}}-\mathit{\mathbf{I}}\right)$ to access the performance of 
% the algorithms written in part (a),  and (b). Comment on the results obtained.
for n=2:16
a= hilb(n); % n is the size of the matrix
[q_gs,r1] = gschmidt(a); %using algorithm classical Gram--Schmidt
[q_mgs,r2] = mgschmidt(a); %using algorithm modified Gram-Schmidt
err_gs(n-1) = norm(q_gs'*q_gs - eye(n),'fro');
err_mgs(n-1) = norm(q_mgs'*q_mgs - eye(n),'fro');

%% 
% *For small Hilbert matrices, both Classical and Modified Gram-Schmidt give 
% similar (small) errors because the system is not too ill-conditioned. However, 
% as the matrix size grows, Hilbert matrices become extremely ill-conditioned, 
% causing the Classical Gram-Schmidt method to accumulate larger rounding errors. 
% Modified Gram-Schmidt is more numerically stable, so its error remains lower 
% for larger n. Thatâ€™s why the plot shows Classical GS errors increasing significantly, 
% while Modified GS errors stay relatively small.*
%% *Question 4: (20 marks)*
% Polynomial fitting is one of the many applications of Least-Squares Approximation. 
% Given the experimental data, shown in Table below, 
% 
% $$\matrix{   Input,, x  | &  x_0  &x_1  & x_2& x_3 &\dots  & x_{m-1}& x_m 
% \crOutput, y| &  y_0 & y_1& y_2 & y_3 & \dots & y_{m-1}&y_m}$$
% 
% we can fit a $n^{\textrm{th}}$degree polynomial, $p\left(x\right)=a_0 +a_1 
% x+a_{2\;} x^{2\;} +a_3 x^3 +\cdots +a_{n\;} x^n$. To find the coefficicients,  
% $\mathit{\mathbf{a}}=\left\lbrack a_{0\;} ,\;\;a_1 ,\;\;a_2 ,\cdots a_n \right\rbrack$, 
% we can solve the linear system shown below. 
% 
% $$\underset{\mathit{\mathbf{M}}}{\underbrace{\left\lbrack \begin{array}{ccccc}1 
% & x_0  & x_0^2  & \cdots  & x_0^n \\1 & x_1  & x_1^2  & \cdots  & x_1^n \\1

% b. Suppose we choose to model the provided data with a polynomial of *degree 
% 17*. Using the cell below, fit a polynomial of degree 17*,* i.e. $p(x) = a_0 
% + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \dots + a_{17} x^{17}$. Select an appropriate algorithm 
% mentioned in Question 2 to find the QR decomposition, justify your choice. You 
% should use the Forward and Backward Substitution which you wrote in the previous 
% Assignment. In order to use the funcitons which used in the previous assignment, 
% you can include those in the Appendix.
% write your code here 
%build our vandermonde matrix with degree 17 
M = Vandermonde_Matrix(x,17);
%use modified gram schmidt from last question for numerical stability

%solve Ra = Q^T_y using backward sub because R is upper triangular 
Qt_y = Q' * y;
a_coeff = backward_sub(R, Qt_y);

% *I used the modified Gram-Schmidt because a 17th degree polynomial means our 
% Vandermonde matrix can be ill-conditioned. (and I was confused by the wording 
% and wasn't sure if the question was trying to say use an algorithm from Q3, 
% therefore no householder.)*
% 
% Now that you have obtained the coefficients, $a_i,  \;\;0\leq i \leq17$ , 
% for the polynomial model, $p(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \dots + a_{17} x^{17}$, 
% we can test this model by evaluating $p\left(x\right)$ at different values of 
% $x$. Since the input data was linearly spaced between 100 to $100+2\pi \;$, 
% you can use 200 linearly spaced points to test the performance of your model.

% c. Is the model you obtained accurate? Investigate the reason behind the poor 
% performance of the model and suggest a method to improve the model performance. 
% Explain your rationale and justify your choice.
% 
% 
% 
% *The model obtained is not accurate, as shown by the significant mismatch 
% between data points and predictions. Usually with a high degree polynomial, 
% there's a risk of overfitting, but our current model doesnt even fit the training 
% data well, so this suggests numerical computation issues rather than overfitting. 
% Potential reasons for poor performance include numerical instability and data

%% 
% Write a brief summary on how you obtained the correct model.
% 
% *I improved the polynomial fitting by implementing data normalization to address 
% numerical instability issues. The original model performed poorly because the 
% x-values around 100 led to extreme scaling problems when raised to high powers 
% in the 17th-degree Vandermonde matrix. By normalizing the x-values to have zero 
% mean and unit standard deviation before constructing the Vandermonde matrix, 
% I significantly improved the numerical conditioning of the system.*
%% Question 5: (10 marks) 
% You are tasked with designing a computer program for obtaining polynomial 
% models using least squares approximation. This would typically require the solution 
% of an overdetermined system $\mathbf{A} \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$, where the 
% matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is a Vandermonde matrix known for being ill-conditioned. 
% You have access to a standard numerical library (such as MATLAB, for example) 
% with the following methods available to you that you can use without modification:
%% 
% * Fundamental matrix and vector operations (multiplication, addition, etc.)
% * $\text{Norm}(\mathbf{A}, n)$: Returns the $L_n$ norm of $\mathbf{A}$.
% * $[\mathbf{L}, \mathbf{U}, \mathbf{P}] = \text{PLU}(\mathbf{A})$: Returns 
% $\mathbf{L}$, $\mathbf{U}$, and $\mathbf{P}$ such that $\mathbf{P} \mathbf{A} 
% = \mathbf{L} \mathbf{U}$ (Partial pivoting).
% * $[\mathbf{L}, \mathbf{U}] = \text{LU}(\mathbf{A})$: Returns $\mathbf{L}$ 
% and $\mathbf{U}$ such that $\mathbf{L} \mathbf{U} = \mathbf{A}$(No pivoting).
% * $\mathbf{A}^T = \text{transp}(\mathbf{A})$: Returns the transpose of $\mathbf{A}$.
% * $\mathbf{L} = \text{Chol}(\mathbf{A})$: Returns $\mathbf{L}$ such that $\mathbf{A} 
% = \mathbf{L} \mathbf{L}^T$ (Uses Cholesky decomposition â€“ $\mathbf{A}$ must 
% be symmetric positive definite).
% * $[\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{R}] = \text{MGSqr}(\mathbf{A})$: Returns $\mathbf{Q}$ 
% and $\mathbf{R}$ such that $\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{Q} \mathbf{R}$ (Uses the modified 
% Gram-Schmidt algorithm).
% * $[\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{R}] = \text{HouseholderQR}(\mathbf{A})$: Returns $\mathbf{Q}$ 
% and $\mathbf{R}$ such that $\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{Q} \mathbf{R}$ (Uses Householder 
% reflections).
% * $[\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{R}] = \text{GivensQR}(\mathbf{A})$: Returns $\mathbf{Q}$ 
% and $\mathbf{R}$ such that $\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{Q} \mathbf{R}$ (Uses Givens 
% rotations).
% * $\mathbf{y} = \text{FwdSub}(\mathbf{L}, \mathbf{b})$: Returns $\mathbf{y}$ 
% such that $\mathbf{L} \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{b}$ (*L* must be lower triangular).
% * $\mathbf{x} = \text{BwdSub}(\mathbf{U}, \mathbf{y})$: Returns $\mathbf{x}$ 
% such that $\mathbf{U} \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{y}$ ( $\mathbf{U}$ must be upper 
% triangular).
%% 
% You are tasked with solving this problem using *Tikhonov Regularization*. 
% Write a MATLAB program that computes $\mathbf{x}$, given $\mathbf{A}$and $\mathbf{b}$. 
% You can use any of the functions outlined above if needed.  
function x = tikhonov_regularization(A, b, lambda)
    %lambda is the regularization parameter
    
    %we're just solving the closed-form solution: x = (A^T A + Î»I)^(-1) A^T b
    [m, n] = size(A);
    ATA = transp(A) * A;
    regularized_matrix = ATA + lambda * eye(n);
    ATb = transp(A) * b;
    
    %use householder for stability

% There are a number of possible implementations or answers to this problem.

% 
% 
% 
% *Rationale:*
% 
% *I chose Householder QR decomposition because it's numerically more stable 
% than other methods like LU for solving the regularized system. Using Tikhonov 
% Regularization, we are able to deal with the problem of Vandermonde matrices 
% becoming increasingly ill-conditioned as we get to higher degree polynomials. 
% I implemented the solution without explicitly computing the inverse of (A^T 
% A + Î»I), which avoids additional numerical instability that would arise from 
% matrix inversion. Instead, the QR decomposition approach provides a more direct 
% and stable way to solve the regularized system. Therefore, Tikhonov Regularization 
% serves as a better approach than our previous one for solving for the solution 
% vector x.*
